# Internet-of-Bees

Internet of Bees is a project for inexpensive and simple monitoring of beehives. We focus on low-cost hardware and products that every beekeeper can handle.

At the moment we are building the basics of the application. As soon as there is a production ready version of the app, we will announce it here.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
